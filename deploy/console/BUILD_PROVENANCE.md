- Reproducibility epoch: `1784603018` (the upstream Console commit timestamp)

The source map is disabled for the production artifact. A second build from
the same tree resolved to the same image ID. The runtime includes the upstream
Apache-2.0 license and NVIS attribution notice.

## Runtime boundary

The Console listens only on appserver loopback (`127.0.0.1:4300`) and its
management address (`192.168.10.3:4300`). Same-origin `/api/` and `/oapi/`
requests proxy to the existing Manager listener at `127.0.0.1:12004`.
Authentication, JWT/RBAC, credential storage, and first-login behavior remain
owned by and compatible with Manager.

## Verification record

- Both health endpoints returned HTTP 200.
- Manager `/healthy` returned HTTP 200 through the proxy.
- An unauthenticated `/api/v1/clusters` request returned HTTP 401.
- `/signin`, the versioned JavaScript, favicon, and SPA fallback returned HTTP 200.
- Every emitted file passed the bundled `SHA256SUMS` manifest.
- Emitted visible branding is NVIS-P2P. The two retained `dragonfly` strings
  are non-brand behavior/attribution: the required upstream first-login
  comparison and the upstream client documentation URL.
- The container runs as UID/GID `101:101`, with a read-only root filesystem,
  all Linux capabilities dropped, and `no-new-privileges` enabled.
